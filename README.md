3D Object Similarity Comparison Using the SimSiam Network

This study involves the utilization of newly designed networks based on ResNet and SimSiam for comparing the similarity of 3D objects. And eight random 2D views of the 3D objects were extracted and used as inputs for this network.

### Developement Environment
Python 3.10.4  
cudatoolkit 11.3  
PyTorch 1.11.0  
cudnn 8.4.1  


### Extraction of Random 2D Views for 3D Objects
The utilized 3D dataset is ShapeNetCore.v1, and this dataset is used to randomly extract 2D views from multiple angles.
